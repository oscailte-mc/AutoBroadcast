# AutoBroadcast

AutoBroadcast is a simple and asynchronous plugin which allows users to broadcast configurable messages at regular intervals. 
It supports both [MiniMessage](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage) and [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) allowing for a great degree of customizability. 

There is documentation on how to configure and set up the plugin [here](https://docs.conch.rocks/autobroadcast/).

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, please base your PRs off of `autobroadcast:develop` rather than master.
## Tasks

- [ ] New version checking and notification system
- [ ] Provide French Localisation
- [ ] Croudin integration for public contributions of localisations
- [ ] Fancy github badges
- [ ] CD
- [ ] Add configuration support for titles, sounds and that sort of thing. 
- [ ] More pretty MiniMessage examples.

Feature suggestions are always welcome, however this is aiming to be a simple and lightweight plugin, so it's unlikely
I'll implement everything.
